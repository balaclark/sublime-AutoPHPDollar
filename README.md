**Add "$" symbol before PHP variable name**

AutoPHPDollar automatically insters "$" character before variables,
improves speed and convenience of PHP coding.

AutoPHP$ sublime text 2 plugin

Lets define the variable as a list of rules, for example:
 - the text followed by "="
 - the text that starts with "$"
 - the text that already has been defined as a variable

Lets add starting "$" to the any text
that looks like variable

Roadmap and TODO:
- avoid of adding "$" inside comments and text blocks
- improve variables detection
